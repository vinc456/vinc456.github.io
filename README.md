I've been playing around with Jekyll for two days and it is unfortunate that I have to install some Ruby packages like Bundler if I wish to [Setting up your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/#step-2-install-jekyll-using-bundler) This could all be done within a VM but I also find the workflow and Jekyll itself to be rather cumbersome. So for now I am forced to test changes by pushing directly to production, sometimes without of even previewing my changes. In 2019 there must be some better alternative.

Hello world, today a blog is (re)born! Incidentally GitHub has announced unlimited private repositories for free users so that might have something to do with it! See [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/adjw6g/github_now_gives_free_users_unlimited_private/) and [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18847043). I don't plan to blog so much as dump random snippets and notes on things I've read. Previous incarnations of my website appeared in the form of a [Hatta Wiki](http://test.hatta-wiki.org/) but I suppose the collaborative nature of Github suits this purpose well. Markdown is still supported so the [basic writing and formatting syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#links) will be familiar.

["If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_a_tree_falls_in_a_forest) I suppose people are curious regarding my relative silence and a "narrative" is required. That will be for another post. For now I will leave you with a question and answer. [Ask HN: How to found a company as a single founder?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18855704) and an answer [Seven tough lessons from ten years in bootstrapped business](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18582553).

These days my main interest is in cybersecurity and that will be my focus of my writings. The old saying goes: "Premature optimization is the root of all evil" and I share similar sentiments regarding complexity. Hardware, software, platforms, and ecosystems are often unnecessarily complex and many of our security, privacy, and abuse problems stem from that. So a simple, static website hosted on [Github Pages](https://vinc456.github.io/) should suit my needs and my hope is there is little to no maintenance. The only constant in technology is relentless change but I'm sure Github Pages will stand the test of time..... ;)

> Dependency slurping systems like NPM, CPAN, go get, and so on continue to freak me out. They might potentially be more dangerous than manual dependency management, despite the huge risks of that practice, precisely because they make it ‘easy’ to grow your project’s dependency graph — and hence the number of individuals and organizations that you implicitly trust. (And their trustworthiness can suddenly change for the worse.) When there are significant gaps in a language’s standard library, third-party developers will eagerly fill those gaps with new dependencies for you to (not always knowingly) inherit. There is an effort underway to fill gaps in JavaScript’s standard library, which I strongly support for this reason.
