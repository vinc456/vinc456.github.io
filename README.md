### January 7, 2019
Hello world. Today a blog is (re)born.
A few other announcements: [GitHub now gives free users unlimited private repositories](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/adjw6g/github_now_gives_free_users_unlimited_private/).

[The State Of Software Security In 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/adkvu1/the_state_of_software_security_in_2019_and_what/)

Hardware, software, platforms, and ecosystems are often way too complex, and a whole lot of our security, privacy, and abuse problems stem from that. So this is a simple, static website hosted on [Github Pages](https://vinc456.github.io/). Having gone through Launchpad, Github and the evolution of cvs, bazaar, bzr, darcs, git, I'm sure Github Pages will stand the test of time..... ;) The only constant in technology is relentless change.


Random notes
> Dependency slurping systems like NPM, CPAN, go get, and so on continue to freak me out. They might potentially be more dangerous than manual dependency management, despite the huge risks of that practice, precisely because they make it ‘easy’ to grow your project’s dependency graph — and hence the number of individuals and organizations that you implicitly trust. (And their trustworthiness can suddenly change for the worse.) When there are significant gaps in a language’s standard library, third-party developers will eagerly fill those gaps with new dependencies for you to (not always knowingly) inherit. There is an effort underway to fill gaps in JavaScript’s standard library, which I strongly support for this reason.
