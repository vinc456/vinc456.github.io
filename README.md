Hello world, today a blog is (re)born! Incidentally GitHub has announced unlimited private repositories for free users so that might have something to do with it! [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/adjw6g/github_now_gives_free_users_unlimited_private/) and [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18847043). I don't plan to blog so much as dump random snippets and notes on things I've read. Previous incarnations of my website appeared in the form of a [Hatta Wiki](http://test.hatta-wiki.org/) but I suppose the collaborative nature of Github suits this purpose well. Markdown is still supported so the [basic writing and formatting syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#links) will be familiar.

The saying goes: "Premature optimization is the root of all evil" and I share similar sentiments regarding complexity. Hardware, software, platforms, and ecosystems are often unnecessarily complex and many of our security, privacy, and abuse problems stem from that. So a simple, static website hosted on [Github Pages](https://vinc456.github.io/) should suit my needs and my hope is there is little to no maintenance. The only constant in technology is relentless change but I'm sure Github Pages will stand the test of time..... ;) Just the thought of MSFT's recent changes and the rapid evolution of VCS ranging from bzr, cvs, bazaar, bzr, darcs, git is enough to make my head spin!

> Dependency slurping systems like NPM, CPAN, go get, and so on continue to freak me out. They might potentially be more dangerous than manual dependency management, despite the huge risks of that practice, precisely because they make it ‘easy’ to grow your project’s dependency graph — and hence the number of individuals and organizations that you implicitly trust. (And their trustworthiness can suddenly change for the worse.) When there are significant gaps in a language’s standard library, third-party developers will eagerly fill those gaps with new dependencies for you to (not always knowingly) inherit. There is an effort underway to fill gaps in JavaScript’s standard library, which I strongly support for this reason.
